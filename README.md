Besides a backup for, and a documentation of, working through CS50, this repository is also an exploration of how Git's features can be utilised in learning, reviewing and teaching the material that is captured in the version-controlled files.

For example, commit messages may hint at the core lesson a particular change-set should convey. Descriptions may be useful for initially hiding details or further hints from the learner.

### Please note

History will be rewritten a lot, because this concept develops. Currently, each file will live on a different [branch](https://github.com/gittaca/HarvardX-CS50/branches).

### To do

- [ ] learn about tags & see how they could be used
- [ ] test different file, folder & branch organisation strategies
